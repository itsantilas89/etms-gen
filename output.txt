Right now your pipeline is doing exactly what we asked it to do, and it’s basically saying:

“All 1440 synthetic snapshots are numerically solvable, but none of them meet the very strict limits you set.”

And then in step 12 it tried really hard to scale them into the “safe” box and concluded:

“Even if I shrink them towards zero, I can’t get into that box under those rules.”
